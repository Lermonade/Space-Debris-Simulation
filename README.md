# Space Debris Remediaton Simulation

This project is a work-in-progress simulation capable of predicting the effects of various space debris remediation methods, such as ground or space based laser ablation and chaser vehicles. The simulation will be capable of accurate orbital propegation, and will simulate the growth of space debris populations over time. Various remediation methods can be designed and placed in the scene, and the simulation will track useful variables associated with these methods.

The simulation will include a 3D visualization and intuitive menu, and it is being developed as a JavaFX application.
